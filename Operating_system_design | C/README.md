# Project: Create a basic OS

Given some of C basic library, we had to design an OS interacting with the hardware.

In the primary functions, we implemented functions which are used directly by the kernel when it starts, for example a clock, the function to print something in the console, the creation and switching context of process...

In the user oriented functions, we implemented functionnalities which are presented to the user, for example the ability to call malloc.

# Ressources

There is no general pdf of this project, but you can find some in modules, for example for malloc.
