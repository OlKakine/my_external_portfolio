# my_external_portfolio

This repository contains various projects I have participated in outside Github. It is mostly adressed to potential employers.

Most of those projects where done in my french school, so many files, subjects and comments are in French, even though I tried to make it easier for English people to read and explore my portfolio.

I have to say it wasn't easy to transfer some of those projects from Gitlab that we use in my school. So it is possible that you find that hard to know what I have actually done in some projects (especially the ones which were done in groups) but I cannot really make it easier because the repositories in Gitlab are private and cannot be shared.

## As a general rule:

-There is a subject in pdf (often 'sujet.pdf') in French which explains what was expected from me.
-In the `src` folder, there are all the files I implemented, given a skeleton (for example a header)
-A README file explains what the project is about (there are none for simple exercises)
-Project are not necessarily ready to be executed because I removed files I didn't implement and some projects use libraries which were local to the school computers.

# Conclusion

I hope that this helped you to understand better my experiences as a Software and Systems Engineer.

Please feel free to check the report (unfortunately in French) of my internship I did at SAP that you can find as another repository of this account.
