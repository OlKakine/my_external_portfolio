# Project: Simulate the flow of a fluid 

Given some initial conditions, and using the differential equations of transport and diffusion, we (a group of two student) had to compute and then display the evolution of a fluid.

# Implemented files

Every files in src, including some implementation of Cholesky algorithms on matrices.
