# Project: Optimization of the calcuation of connexes components

The goal of this project was to come up with an optimized way to compute, given a set of points and a minimal distance, the number of connexes components.

I used a Divide and Conquer approach by grouping points in cases constructed in a grid made in [quadrillage.py](quadrillage.py).

The main program is [connectes.py](connectes.py).

There are also some test cases and some performance images.
